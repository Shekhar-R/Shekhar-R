**Summary (Abstract)**

“Don’t Forget About Me” (2025), directed by Elle Mills, explores the cost of people-pleasing and the struggle to reclaim personal ambition. The short film follows Owen Connelly, a former child star known as Magical Matty, who has grown jaded after years of prioritizing others’ wishes over his own. Owen’s journey highlights the tension between selflessness and self-fulfillment. The story underscores the emotional toll of neglecting personal aspirations for external approval, offering a poignant reflection on the importance of self-worth and ambition. Mills’ film serves as a reminder that pursuing one’s own goals is essential for genuine growth and fulfillment.

<h2>Short Essay on Ambition</h2>

In an epidemic of people pleasing, DON'T FORGET ABOUT ME (2025), directed by Elle Mills, displays the repercussions of neglecting your own goals and self-worth. It has become common today to believe that the act of people pleasing and consistently helping others will lead them to reciprocate their help and praise when you are in need. DON’T FORGET ABOUT ME follows the main character, Owen Connelly, as the grown-up, jaded version of his former self. He grew up as Magical Matty, granter of all wishes. Although Magical Matty was just a fictional character in a fictional show, it is evident that the character had a mental impact on him as he was always working for other people and always granting other people's wishes. He has transformed from a widely loved child star into a distant figure, removed from the fame that once defined him. By focusing on helping others rather than himself, Owen overlooks the deeper problem of avoiding his personal ambition and fulfillment. He uses selflessness as a way to sidestep the discomfort of pursuing his own goals. Throughout the short film, viewers follow Owen's journey as he reclaims his personal ambition through changes in attitude, emotional metaphors, and the creation of his own list of wishes.

Owen's personal ambition evolves throughout the short film through a shift in his attitude. At first, he appears detached and indifferent, lounging in a chair, eating cereal, and casually joking about being on shrooms. He explains the dark consequences of the list of wishes with unsettling nonchalance. He goes on to explain that if they are not completed in time, "sacrifices will be made and a loved one will disappear" (Elle Mills). Even as the sibling’s debate whether to send him to a psych ward, Owen remains unbothered. His sarcastic remark, "Hey, do you guys wanna get going on this list, or are you just fine with mommy going bye-bye?" shows his lack of care for the wishes he is granting, the siblings, or the acting job the situation is supposed to be (Elle Mills). However, his attitude shifts by the end of the film to be more positive and caring. In the car ride to fulfill the final wish, Owen challenges the siblings to view their bitterness toward their father from a different perspective by asking, "If he gets the chance to start over, shouldn't your mom get that same chance?" (Elle Mills). This moment reflects a deeper change in Owen's mindset and suggests that he is may also be hoping for a chance to start over.

Owen demonstrates growth in personal ambition through the visual metaphor of fog. At the beginning of the short film, he appears in the garage surrounded by purple fog, just like he appeared in the show Magical Matty. As the fog clears, Magical Matty emerges ready to grant Kendall and Jamie's wishes. The fog represents his jaded mindset and tendency to prioritize others over himself. By stepping back into his childhood role at his agent's request, he avoids pursuing his true passion for writing. By the end of the short film, Owen is seen back in the foggy garage, but this time packing up the fog machine for good. Although he had the chance to leave when Kendall asked, "Are you gonna help us or not?" he chose to stay and complete the final wish, no longer treating the experience as an acting job but as a chance for personal growth (Elle Mills). Leaving the fog behind symbolizes Owen's decision to move forward and step away from his past. His journey with Kendall and Jamie helps him to realize the importance of living for himself and finally stepping out of the fog, both literally and emotionally.

Owen's final step toward reclaiming his ambition and letting go of his jaded persona comes at the end of the film when he creates his own wish list. He writes, "1. I wish I was filth rich, 2. I wish I was a successful writer/director, and 3. I wish I could feel as loved now as I did for who I used to be” (Elle Mills). His decision to pursue his own script, revealed in a final phone call with his agent, reflects a shift in mindset that aligns with his second wish. This contrasts with the opening scene, where he agrees to take on an acting job to help Kendall and Jamie, despite acting no longer being his passion. That choice shows he was still putting others before himself. Writing down the list of wishes marks a turning point in Owen's character development. This final step shows that he is no longer neglecting his self-worth by wanting a change for himself.

Owen's focus to help others before himself highlights his struggle to pursue his own ambitions. In the final scene of the short film, there is a voiceover of young Kendall and Jamie reading their original letter back to Owen, saying, "P.S. Have you thought about granting your own wishes? Not sure if that's against the rules, but I think you deserve it" (Elle Mills). Through the change in his attitude from jaded to hopeful, the use of fog as an emotional metaphor, and writing a series of career goals, Owen proves that he deserves to grant his own wishes. As stated in the Harvard Business Review, “People-pleasing is not only what you do, but a strong part of who you believe you are… you need to condition yourself to be less sensitive to other people’s needs and more aware of your own so you can stay in balance” (Saunders). The short film and supporting article serve as an important life lesson for anyone who treats themselves like Owen. It is important to invest in your time and to stop letting other people influence what you do.

### PEER REVIEW — CTS*4000 (Fall 2025) — Reviewer: Shekhar Rana

1) Communication, Style, and Polish (/5)
Your voice is clear and the argument tracks logically from setup (people-pleasing) to examples (Owen’s actions) to a concluding life lesson. Paragraphing is strong and transitions are generally smooth (“However,” “By the end…”). You could tighten a few sentences for concision (e.g., combine the two consecutive sentences that restate Magical Matty’s impact) and standardize capitalization for the film title throughout. A global find/replace on quotes/apostrophes will clean this up quickly. Also consider trimming repeated context (the premise appears twice in similar wording in the opening). 
→ Score: 4.5/5

2) Relevance to Special Issue Theme (/5)
The submission can map more explicitly to CTRL+ALT+DH’s theme of creativity in digital spaces. You already analyzed a YouTube short by a creator who built a career in online video; that’s perfect terrain to discuss platformized creativity (creator labour, audience expectation, and parasocial pressures) and how “people-pleasing” is intensified by metrics and algorithmic visibility. A short paragraph could connect Owen’s recovery of ambition to creators reclaiming authorship from platform incentives (e.g., choosing to write/direct rather than chase engagement). A brief nod to the creator-economy context would deepen the fit.
→ Score: 3.5/5

3) Originality, Creativity, and Strength of Ideas (/5)
Your reading of fog as a visual/emotional metaphor is compelling, and the link between the wish list and a reframing of ambition is persuasive. I especially like the pivot where Owen challenges the siblings; that moment supports your thesis that he’s also negotiating his own restart. To push further: consider one counter-reading (e.g., is “selflessness” actually avoidance, or can it be reframed as relational care?) to show critical range, then reaffirm your claim.
→ Score: 4/5

4) Accuracy and Completion of Markdown Code (/5)
What works: headings and paragraphs render cleanly, citations are listed, and links are present. What’s missing for the journal pipeline: a complete metadata block (title, date, issue, author, abstract/summary, tags, bio, and citation). Also, convert in-text references to footnotes with Markdown syntax and ensure all external links are embedded (the second link doesn't work). Finally, confirm consistent heading levels and consider adding alt-text if you later include any stills. 
→ Score: 3.5/5

Total: 15.5/20

ACTIONABLE CHECKLIST

- Verify all links are live.
- Optional: add a one-sentence counter-reading to strengthen the argument.

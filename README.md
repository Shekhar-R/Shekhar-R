## Project Description

This essay critically analyzes the digital exhibit *Islands in the North* by Dr. Marlene Gaynair through the lens of Kimberl√© Crenshaw‚Äôs theory of intersectionality. It explores how data visualization, GIS mapping, and digital archives can be forms of **creative activism**, challenging historical erasure and reframing belonging in Toronto‚Äôs Black diasporic communities.  

> ‚ÄúWithout frames that allow us to see how social problems impact all the members of a targeted group, many will fall through the cracks of our movements.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî Kimberl√© Crenshaw, *The Urgency of Intersectionality* (2016)


Written for the Fall 2025 *CTRL+ALT+DH* issue, **‚ÄúA Byte of Creativity,‚Äù** this work connects the course themes of digital publishing, ethics, and critical design with creative expression in digital spaces.

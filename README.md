## Project Description

This essay critically analyzes the digital exhibit *Islands in the North* by Dr. Marlene Gaynair through the lens of Kimberlé Crenshaw’s theory of intersectionality.  
It explores how data visualization, GIS mapping, and digital archives can be forms of **creative activism**, challenging historical erasure and reframing belonging in Toronto’s Black diasporic communities.  

Written for the Fall 2025 *CTRL+ALT+DH* issue, **“A Byte of Creativity,”** this work connects the course themes of digital publishing, ethics, and critical design with creative expression in digital spaces.

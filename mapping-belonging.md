# Mapping Belonging: An Intersectional Critique of *Islands in the North*

Toronto is often celebrated for its diversity, but who gets remembered in its official histories—and who gets left out? *Islands in the North*, a digital exhibit created by Dr. Marlene Gaynair, reimagines the city through the experiences of Black Caribbean immigrants. This interactive project overlays archives, oral histories, music, advertisements, and photographs onto a map of Toronto, bringing to life the people and places that helped shape the city’s Black diasporic culture.

As someone who grew up in Toronto, this project hit close to home. I recognized many of the neighbourhoods on the map—Eglinton West, Bathurst and Bloor, and Rexdale—and discovered stories and organizations I’d never heard of before, like the Jamaican Canadian Association. To critically engage with *Islands in the North*, I turn to Kimberlé Crenshaw’s concept of **intersectionality**, a framework that helps reveal how overlapping systems of power, race, gender, class, and migration shape lived experiences. Crenshaw reminds us that without the right frame, some people remain invisible. *Islands in the North* builds that missing frame. It gives us a multidimensional view of Toronto that resists the flattening of Black Caribbean life into a single narrative.

## Re-mapping Black Toronto

The project is described as a “(re)creation of space and place in the archive”[^2]—a digital effort to map what Gaynair calls “Black Toronto.” Gaynair uses GIS tools to visualize cultural landmarks, community organizations, and popular gathering places, both past and present. The interface is clean but extensive: users can scroll through the interactive **Making Space** map, search the OMEKA-powered database, or explore a now-inactive visual timeline called **Making Place**.

The map features points categorized as churches, bakeries, nightclubs, community centres, beauty salons, and more. Each entry offers basic metadata like the name, address, and operational dates. Some database entries go deeper, including posters, personal descriptions, and archival photos. For example, Scooter’s Roller World in Rexdale is listed with a flyer from a “gangster rap extravaganza”[^2] in 1992, while the Horseshoe Tavern is noted as a key music venue in the 1990s.

What intrigued me most was how the project embraces **Black cultural geography**, using spatial tools to make visible the ways Black life has always been embedded in the city—even if mainstream histories don’t reflect that.

## Intersectionality in Action

Crenshaw’s theory of intersectionality comes from her legal and activist work, which revealed that social justice movements often overlook people whose identities span multiple marginalized categories. As she puts it, “Without frames that allow us to see how social problems impact all the members of a targeted group, many will fall through the cracks of our movements.”[^1]

*Islands in the North* builds such a frame. By highlighting the spaces that Black Caribbean immigrants built and occupied, it acknowledges the overlapping forces of **migration, racialization, gender, and class**. These intersections shape everything—from where communities could afford to live, to what kinds of social spaces they created, to how those spaces were policed or erased over time.

For example, the neighbourhood around Eglinton West, still known today for its Caribbean shops and restaurants, takes on deeper meaning when viewed through this map. Places like Bathurst and Bloor, which might not seem like obvious hubs of Black culture today, are revealed to have once played key roles in community life. The project not only brings these stories to light but also invites users to rethink the racial history of familiar places.

Crenshaw asks why some lives and experiences are invisible in our public memory. *Islands in the North* answers that question with **data, design, and care**.

## Design, Data, and Digital Activism

This project is a clear example of **data activism**: it uses digital tools not to extract or flatten Black experience but to expand and deepen it. The GIS map is built using open data from the City of Toronto and enriched with public archives, newspaper clippings, oral history, and social media. It doesn’t just show where things happened; it shows why they mattered.

Still, there are design limitations. Some database entries are sparse—for example, “City Hall” is listed with no context about its significance to Black Toronto—and hyperlinks between the map and the database would make exploration easier. The **Making Place** timeline didn’t load at the time of writing, which feels like a missed opportunity to show how community spaces changed over time.

That said, the platform excels at encouraging discovery. A simple dot on the map led me to the Jamaican Canadian Association, which I then researched further, learning about its roots in Jamaica’s independence movement and its role in Toronto’s Caribbean diaspora. This kind of organic learning is one of the site’s quiet strengths.

## Conclusion: Framing the City Differently

Crenshaw[^1] ends her TED Talk by calling us to move “from mourning and grief to action and transformation.” *Islands in the North* is a project of transformation: it remaps Toronto to centre the lives of those often pushed to the margins. By foregrounding Black Caribbean experiences, it challenges myths of a neutral, post-racial Canada and insists on more complex narratives of belonging.

As a Torontonian, I found myself both recognizing and re-seeing my city. This project reframes the urban landscape—not just geographically, but historically, politically, and emotionally. In doing so, it refuses to let Black Canadian histories be erased. It invites us to remember, to witness, and most importantly, to see.

## Artist/Research Statement

This essay explores how digital archives can act as both creative and critical spaces. *Islands in the North* demonstrates that mapping is not only a technical act but a cultural one—an effort to reclaim erased histories through design. By analyzing this exhibit through Kimberlé Crenshaw’s framework of intersectionality, I aim to show how data visualization can also be a form of activism, one that broadens public understanding of belonging and identity in Toronto’s digital landscape.
